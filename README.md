Installation
============

Scripts are designed to extend @eworm-de's excellent [routeros-scripts](https://github.com/eworm-de/routeros-scripts) project, it's a prerequisite.

E.g. ipv6-dns can be installed via:

    $ScriptInstallUpdate ipv6-dns "base-url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kentzo/routeros-scripts-custom/main/"

Note that scripts may depend on modules in *mod/\**, check the header before installation.
